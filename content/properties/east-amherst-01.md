## Property Overview
Absolutely Stunning! This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom end townhouse is a gem. The lowest level has an egress window installed for additional living space, making it even more spacious (measuring 1655 square feet according to appraiser's measurements).

This beautifully renovated home exudes class and charm. As you step into the great room with a cozy fireplace, you'll notice the elegant luxury vinyl flooring that extends throughout the first floor. The kitchen is a true showstopper, featuring exquisite white cabinetry complemented by pristine snow-white quartz countertops and a convenient breakfast bar. The kitchen boasts exceptional quality, including an extra deep sink, recessed lighting, and brand-new appliances. A pantry adds to the functionality of this amazing kitchen.

Just off the kitchen, you'll find a newly expanded concrete patio with a privacy fence, creating a perfect outdoor space.

Both bathrooms have undergone complete and stunning renovations, adding to the overall appeal of this beautiful home.
